# Cyclistic bike share analysis Case Study

# Project Overview
As a junior data analyst for Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago, the goal is to analyze bike usage patterns to differentiate between annual members and casual riders. The insights will guide the marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members and improve overall company performance.

The analysis shows that annual members predominantly use Cyclistic bikes for commuting during weekdays, while casual riders prefer leisure rides on weekends. Annual members use the bikes more frequently, but casual riders have longer average ride lengths. To improve company performance, we can highlight to casual riders that they could save money by becoming annual members, as their longer rides are costlier. Additionally, introducing a new annual weekend plan offering unlimited weekend rides could attract casual riders to become members.
